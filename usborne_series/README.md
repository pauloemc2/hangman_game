# Python Challenges: Usborne Series
One of the most important independent publishers in the world, the Usborne Publishing is responsible for a series of periodics on computer 
programming in the UK destined for begginers and enthusiasts during the 80s. Aimed mostly at children who were learning how to make programs
using the popular home computers at the time, some of those books taught how to create games with varying complexity.

Inspired on the works of the youtuber [Kari Lawler](https://www.youtube.com/@karilawler), I'm now recreating some of those games using Python.
Some will be recreated as intended by the old books and most will have personal touches added.

Those books are really fantastic and, albeit working upon programming languages not so popular by today standards, they can teach us many
important things regarding programming logic and hardware behaviour.

Fortunately, Usborn Publishing keeps an pdf archive will all their programming books [here](https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books).

dedicated to the UK.
